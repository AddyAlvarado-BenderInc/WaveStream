# Automation Folder

This folder contains **example automation modules** that demonstrate various automated processes within the application. These modules are provided as reference implementations and can be safely modified or replaced with your own automation logic.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**All modules in this folder can and should be deleted** if you plan to implement your own automation solutions. These are example implementations designed to show you how to structure automation tasks, not production-ready code that must be preserved.

## Module Overview

The automation modules included are:

- **Example processing modules** - Demonstrate various automated workflows
- **Template implementations** - Show best practices for automation structure
- **Reference code** - Illustrate integration patterns with the main application

## Critical Module Exception

### ProcessProducts.cs

**This module has limited criticality** - it's only important if you plan to:
- Fill the products table with data
- Implement product editing functionality  
- Upload product information programmatically

If you're not working with product management features, this module can also be safely removed.

## Getting Started

1. **Review the existing modules** to understand the automation patterns
2. **Delete the example modules** when ready to implement your own
3. **Create your custom automation** following the established patterns
4. **Test thoroughly** before deploying to production

## Best Practices

- Follow the existing naming conventions for new modules
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Document your automation logic clearly
- Consider the impact on application performance
